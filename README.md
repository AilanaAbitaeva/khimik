 ## Building and running the project
 
 ### SDK/tools for working with the project
  * Access to a browser with internet.
  * [Tilda](https://tilda.cc/ru/) - website builder and web design platform.

 ### Running a project on a local machine
  1.	Log into tilda account.
  2.  Select a site (from the list of made ones).
  3.  Urther edit or create new pages.
  4.  After editing is over, click on **"publish"**.
  5.  Follow the link to the published site.
 ### Deployed
  1.  Go to **Site Settings → Domain**, register the desired domain, save the changes and see which **IP address** the system suggests to use to connect the domain.
  2.  Next, in the settings of **DNS** records (not DNS servers) at your registrar, create a **Record of type A**, with the value **@**, which would point to the IP address proposed in the **Site Settings → Domain**.
  3.  And a **record of type A**, with the value **www**, which would point to the IP address offered in **Site Settings → Domain**

 ## Technical debt
 
 ### Notes on what the project is not doing as well
  - I would like to add more beautiful animations to the site.
  - I would like to replace some of the photos with photos with better quality, including the logo.
  - Make a set of colors applied to each page and changeable in one single place, and not each page separately.
  - There are several links to different photo albums, videos, regulations and application forms located on different platforms, which in general degrades the UX.
 
 ## Requirements for contributors
  1. Follow the color scheme.
  2. Be able to work with zero-blocks.
  3. Be able to adapt pages to different screen sizes.
