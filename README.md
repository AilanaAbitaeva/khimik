# Khimik
The essence of the project - development of an iOS application that will allow you to stroll around the sculpture garden. The sculpture garden consists of 3d models that have formed an augmented reality in the park near the Vrubel building. Models can also be arranged in a home environment.
## Theme Demo

 ## Building and running the project
 
 ### SDK/tools for working with the project
  * Access to a browser with internet.
  * [Tilda] (https://tilda.cc/ru/) - website builder and web design platform.

 ### Running a project on a local machine
  1.	Log into tilda account.
  2.  Select a site (from the list of made ones).
  3.  Urther edit or create new pages.
  4.  After editing is over, click on **"publish"**.
  5.  Follow the link to the published site.
 ### Deployed
  1.  Go to **Site Settings → Domain**, register the desired domain, save the changes and see which **IP address** the system suggests to use to connect the domain.
  2.  Next, in the settings of **DNS** records (not DNS servers) at your registrar, create a **Record of type A**, with the value **@**, which would point to the IP address proposed in the **Site Settings → Domain**.
  3.  And a **record of type A**, with the value **www**, which would point to the IP address offered in **Site Settings → Domain**

 ## Technical debt
 
 ### Notes on what the project is not doing as well
  - I would like to add more beautiful animations to the site.
  - I would like to replace some of the photos with photos with better quality, including the logo.
  - Make a set of colors applied to each page and changeable in one single place, and not each page separately.
  - There are several links to different photo albums, videos, regulations and application forms located on different platforms, which in general degrades the UX.
 
 ## Requirements for contributors
  1. Follow the color scheme.
  2. Be able to work with zero-blocks.
  3. Be able to adapt pages to different screen sizes.
